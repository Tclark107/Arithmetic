This is a project that will test my ability to write an ADT
using another ADT that I had previously built and tested.
It will be interesting as it will allow me to build a form of 
calculator that can handle arbitrarily large numbers by breaking
them up and storing them in lists.

Thus far I have worked: 9.5 hours
on this.

List.h
Header file for List ADT.

List.c
Previously built ADT with minor adjustments made.

BigInteger.h
Header file for BigInteger ADT.

BigInteger.c
ADT that will handle arbitrarily large numbers using my List ADT.

Arithmetic.c
Client module.
